This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 uart_top_/tfifo_/mem_reg has an input control pin uart_top_/tfifo_/mem_reg/ENBWREN (net: uart_top_/tfifo_/mem_reg_ENBWREN_cooolgate_en_sig_2) which is driven by a register (arst_ff_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
